ros-hydro-stage-ros (1.7.1-0quantal) quantal; urgency=high

  * Fixing warnings
  * Small fixes
  * Added RGB+3D-sensor interface (Primesense/Kinect/Xtion).
    * Publishes CameraInfo, depth image, RGBA image, tf (takes world-file pantilt paremeter into account)
    * Supports the "old" configuration (laser+odom) as well as camera+odom, laser+camera+odom and odom-only.
    Fixed laser transform height (previously was hardcoded at 0.15, now it takes robot height into account).
  * Introduced changes from https://github.com/rtv/Stage/issues/34 with some changes (does not require lasers to be present and works without cameras).
